# Zulip Emoji Feed (RC edition)

This simple Astro project presents the RC Zulip custom emoji submitted by the community as a nice little gallery.

Idly browse custom emoji at your leisure! Discover new custom emoji to use in very niche contexts!

In order to view the emoji, one will need to authenticate with the RC's OAuth provider. This is because the emoji's submitter/author is displayed alongside their submission, and also some emoji explicitly have PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in their name and content.

Originally this project set out to provide an RSS feed of the latest emojis for use in other integrations (a RSS Zulip bot, perhaps), but this has been put on hold until I can figure out a way to do this securely, or perhaps indefinitely!
